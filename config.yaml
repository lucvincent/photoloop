# Sync Settings - How often to check for new photos/videos
# ------------------------------------------------------------
sync:
  # How often to automatically sync albums (in minutes)
  # Default: 1440 (24 hours) - syncing is slow due to caption fetching
  # Set to 0 to disable automatic sync (manual only via web interface or CLI)
  # Tradeoff: More frequent = more up-to-date, but uses more bandwidth/CPU
  interval_minutes: 1440

  # Time of day for scheduled sync (24-hour format HH:MM)
  # The first automatic sync will occur at this time, then every interval_minutes after.
  # If omitted, sync starts interval_minutes after service start.
  # Examples:
  #   "03:00" - Sync at 3 AM (good for overnight updates)
  #   "12:00" - Sync at noon
  sync_time: "03:00"

  # Whether to sync immediately when the service starts
  # true = sync right away on startup (useful after adding new albums)
  # false = wait for scheduled sync time
  # Note: This is independent of sync_time - both can trigger syncs
  sync_on_start: false

  # Download resolution
  # true = original quality (larger files, best quality)
  # false = limit to max_dimension (smaller files, faster downloads)
  # Tradeoff: Full resolution uses more storage but looks better on 4K displays
  full_resolution: true
  max_dimension: 1920        # Max width/height if full_resolution is false
                             # Use 3840 for 4K displays

# Display Settings - Slideshow appearance and behavior
# ------------------------------------------------------------
display:
  # Resolution: "auto" detects screen size automatically
  # Or specify explicitly: "1920x1080", "3840x2160" (4K), "1280x720"
  resolution: "auto"

  photo_duration_seconds: 30       # How long each photo is shown
  video_enabled: true              # Set to false to skip videos entirely

  # Transition between photos
  # Options: fade, slide_left, slide_right, slide_up, slide_down, random
  transition_type: "fade"
  transition_duration_ms: 1000     # Transition animation length in milliseconds

  # Photo order - how photos are sequenced in the slideshow
  # Options:
  #   "random"           - Shuffled randomly, re-shuffled each cycle
  #   "recency_weighted" - Random with recency bias (recent photos appear more often)
  #   "alphabetical"     - Sorted by filename (case-insensitive)
  #   "chronological"    - Sorted by date (oldest first)
  #
  # Date priority for chronological/recency_weighted:
  #   1. EXIF date (embedded in photo metadata)
  #   2. Google Photos date (scraped from album)
  #   3. File modification time (fallback)
  order: "random"

  # Recency-weighted mode settings (only used when order: "recency_weighted")
  # This mode biases toward showing recent photos more frequently while still
  # ensuring all photos appear at least once per cycle.
  #
  # How it works:
  #   - Photos are weighted by age: newer photos get higher weight
  #   - Weight decays linearly from 1.0 (today) to recency_min_weight (at cutoff)
  #   - Photos older than recency_cutoff_years all have the same minimum weight
  #   - Higher-weighted photos tend to appear earlier in each shuffled cycle
  #
  # recency_cutoff_years: Photos older than this have equal (minimum) weight
  #   - 5.0 = photos from 5+ years ago are weighted equally
  #   - 1.0 = only last year's photos get boosted
  #   - 10.0 = gradual decay over a decade
  recency_cutoff_years: 5.0

  # recency_min_weight: Weight for photos at/beyond the cutoff age
  #   - 0.33 = old photos are 1/3 as likely to appear early as new photos
  #   - 0.1 = old photos are 1/10 as likely (strong recency bias)
  #   - 1.0 = no recency bias (equivalent to "random")
  recency_min_weight: 0.33

  # Display power control method for off-hours and stop/start
  # Controls how the physical display is turned off to save power
  #   "auto"  - Try methods in order: wlopm → CEC → black screen (default)
  #   "wlopm" - Wayland DPMS only (for monitors on labwc/Wayland)
  #   "cec"   - HDMI-CEC only (for TVs that support CEC)
  #   "none"  - Just show black screen, don't control display power
  #
  # Notes:
  #   - "wlopm" requires wlopm and wlr-randr packages (installed by default)
  #   - "cec" requires cec-utils package and TV with HDMI-CEC support
  #   - "none" is useful if power control causes issues with your display
  power_control: "auto"

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Scaling and Cropping - How photos fill the screen
# ------------------------------------------------------------
scaling:
  # Scaling mode determines how photos fit the screen:
  #   "fill"     - Scale to fill entire screen, crop excess (no black bars)
  #   "fit"      - Scale to fit within screen, may have black bars
  #   "balanced" - Crop up to max_crop_percent, then show bars for the rest
  #                (good compromise between fill and fit)
  #   "stretch"  - Stretch to fill (distorts aspect ratio - not recommended)
  mode: "fill"

  # For "balanced" mode: maximum percentage of image that can be cropped (0-50)
  # Lower values = more bars but less cropping, higher = more cropping
  # Example: 15 means crop up to 15% before showing bars
  max_crop_percent: 15

  # Background color for letterbox/pillarbox bars (fit and balanced modes)
  # RGB color [R, G, B] where each value is 0-255
  background_color: [0, 0, 0]      # Black bars (default)
  # background_color: [32, 32, 32]  # Dark gray bars

  # Smart cropping (applies to fill and balanced modes)
  # When enabled, uses intelligent algorithms to find the best crop region
  # Tradeoff: Enabled = better framing but slightly slower image processing
  smart_crop: true

  # Smart crop method - which algorithm to use for finding crop regions
  # Options:
  #   "face"     - Use face detection (best for photos with people)
  #   "saliency" - Use saliency detection (finds visually interesting regions)
  #   "hybrid"   - Try face detection first, fall back to saliency if no faces
  #
  # Tradeoff:
  #   - "face": Fast, works great for portraits/group photos, ignores non-face subjects
  #   - "saliency": Slower (~200ms/photo), works for any subject (landscapes, objects)
  #   - "hybrid": Most versatile but slowest (tries both methods)
  smart_crop_method: "face"

  # Face detection settings (used when smart_crop_method is "face" or "hybrid")
  # Uses YuNet neural network model for accurate detection
  #
  # Tradeoff:
  #   - true: Faces stay visible in cropped photos, but adds ~50-100ms
  #     processing time per photo and uses more CPU
  #   - false: Faster processing, but faces may be partially cropped
  face_detection: true

  # Where to position detected faces after cropping
  # Options:
  #   "center"         - Center faces in the frame
  #   "rule_of_thirds" - Position faces at rule-of-thirds intersection points
  #   "top_third"      - Position faces in upper third (good for portraits)
  face_position: "center"

  # Fallback crop position when no faces/salient regions are detected
  # Options: "center", "top", "bottom"
  fallback_crop: "center"

  # Crop bias - when cropping is needed, which direction to prefer
  # Options:
  #   "center" - Crop equally from both sides
  #   "top"    - Preserve top of image, crop from bottom (good for landscapes with sky)
  #   "bottom" - Preserve bottom of image, crop from top
  # Only applies when smart cropping doesn't find a specific region to preserve
  crop_bias: "center"

  # Saliency detection settings (used when smart_crop_method is "saliency" or "hybrid")
  # Saliency detection uses a neural network (U2-Net) to find visually important regions
  #
  # saliency_threshold: Minimum saliency score to consider a pixel "important" (0.0-1.0)
  #   - 0.3 = include moderately salient regions (more inclusive)
  #   - 0.5 = only highly salient regions (more selective)
  #   - Lower values = larger "important" regions, more context preserved
  saliency_threshold: 0.3

  # saliency_coverage: What fraction of the salient region must fit in the crop (0.0-1.0)
  #   - 0.9 = crop must contain 90% of the detected salient area
  #   - 0.7 = more aggressive cropping allowed, may cut some salient edges
  #   - Higher values = safer crops but may need more black bars
  saliency_coverage: 0.9

  #             Falls back to black screen if neither available
  #   "clock" - Keep display on and show a simple clock
  #
  # Tradeoff:
  #   - "black": Saves power, extends display lifespan, but display takes
  #     a few seconds to wake up when schedule resumes
  #   - "clock": Always-on display, instant slideshow start, but uses more power
  off_hours_mode: "black"

# Rendered Cache - Pre-processed photos for instant display
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# PhotoLoop caches photos after cropping at your display's native resolution.

# is stored on disk and loaded instantly on subsequent views.
rendered_cache:

  enabled: true

  # Maximum disk space for rendered frames (in MB)
  # 0 = no limit (let cache grow freely)
  # Set a limit if disk space is constrained
  #
  # Size estimates (~2-4 MB per rendered frame at 4K):
  #   - 500 photos → ~1-2 GB
  #   - 1000 photos → ~2-4 GB
  #
  # Note: Rendered frames can be regenerated, so this cache is safe to clear.
  max_size_mb: 0

  # JPEG quality for cached frames (70-100)
  # Higher = better quality but larger files
  #   - 95: Excellent quality, ~2-4 MB per 4K frame (recommended)

cache:
  # Where to store downloaded photos and videos
  directory: "/var/lib/photoloop/cache"

  # Maximum cache size in megabytes
  # When exceeded, oldest photos (by last_seen date) are removed
  #
  # Deletion behavior:
  #   - Photos removed from albums are "soft deleted" (excluded from slideshow)
  #   - Actual files remain on disk until cache exceeds max_size_mb
  #   - When limit is exceeded, soft-deleted files are removed first
  #   - Local directory photos are referenced in-place (not copied to cache)
  #
  # Sizing guide:
  #   - 1080p photos: ~2-5 MB each → 1000 MB ≈ 200-500 photos
  #   - 4K photos: ~8-15 MB each → 1000 MB ≈ 65-125 photos
  #   - With full_resolution: true, photos can be 10-20+ MB each
